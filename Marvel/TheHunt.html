The beast-man Rengar, the Pridestalker, never knew his parents, nor did he know what species
 they were. He was abandoned in the middle of the forest, alone and most likely destined to die.
  However, he was found by a human, who took him to his home and saved him. Rengar grew up with this man, 
  a skilled hunter, and the man saw great potential in Rengar. He decided to teach Rengar his ways, 
  and Rengar eagerly agreed to learn and improve his own skills with his heightened senses and primal 
  instinct. Soon, he became far more skilled than his father, and decided to leave his father and set 
  up his own shack in the forest. He marked a wide area around the shack as his territory, and to 
  scare away potential trespassers, he began mounting the heads of his prey on the border of the marked 
  land. He hunted everyday, and honed his skills. He kept trophies of each prey he had killed in his 
  shack. However, he soon became bored of hunting the animals, as they had become very predictable. It 
  became too easy for him. Day after day, he became more and more worried that he would never feel the 
  “Thrill of the Hunt,” that he would be stuck killing weak, pitiful prey. One day, on a hunt, he came 
  across something...strange. It wasn't beast. Rather, it was an alien. It had huge claws, wings, a shell, 
  and seemed to be a mixture of bug, man, and alien creature. This alien was tearing through the animals 
  around it, consuming everything in sight. This alien was Kha'zix, a beast of the void. Like Cho'gath and 
  Kog'maw, the Void Beasts that came before him, Kha'zix came to the void in search of opportunities to 
  follow his own plans, unknown to everyone except him. For Kha'zix, that meant to adapt, evolve himself 
  to the world around him. Unfortunately for him, the monsters of the void were not enough. He was forced 
  to come to Runeterra through a damaged barrier that separated Runeterra from the Void, located in Icathia.
   He started looking for creatures to consume, but nothing was enough. He needed something more powerful, 
   so he searched the land for  more promising beasts to devour, and use their genes for his own evolution. 
   Like rengar, he has hunted every creature, devoured every predator he could find.  Each kill made him better 
   in some way. His body adapted bigger claws, and wings. He became stronger with every kill. Suddenly, while
    hunting yet another creature, he was struck by a flurry of claws and blades. He had to defend himself, but 
    it wasn't easy. Rengar, too, felt that this wasn't very easy, but a challenge is what he wanted--to feel the 
    "Thrill of the Hunt." Most of his attacks hit armored shell, but some went through. Kha'zix was fighting back,
     using his scythe-like claws and leaving bloody gashes in Rengar's body. Neither wanted to lose this fight, 
     neither wanted to give up. After hours of fighting, Rengar had lost and eye and Kha'zix's body was horribly 
     wounded. they  were both near death, and had to halt the assault on one another to regenerate their strength. 
     Rengar ran back to his den, while Kha'zix ran into the forest. For Kha'zix, regenerating his health wasn't hard. 
     His body was very capable of healing all the wounds using substances retained by his prey. Yet, he couldn't forget
      this fight. This man-beast that he fought was relentless, fearless, and would make a great addition to his collection.
       For Rengar, healing wasn't as easy. It rendered him useless for a long amount of time, but as he was healing, he was 
       happy that he found an opponent that could fight back, and he could finally feel the Thrill of the Hunt. He reserved
        a space for Kha'zix's head on his trophy wall, and it would be the centerpiece of his collection.
